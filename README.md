# YoutubeDownloader
This mod downloads YouTube videos using [YoutubeDLSharp](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Lordfirespeed/YoutubeDLSharp), which requires [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/). If the latter two dependencies do not exist the mod will download them in order to work properly.
- YoutubeDownloader will update BestestTVMod video list after downloading a video, no need to restart the game. 
- I added the ability to paste things into the game window via clipboard too, if you have [LethalConfig](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/AinaVT/LethalConfig) this makes things much easier.
- Playlist mode can download full playlists.
